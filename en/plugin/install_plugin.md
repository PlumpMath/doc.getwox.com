Wox currently supports two ways to install plugins.
* Use the `wpm` command (**recommended**)

  Wox built-in WPM plugin for managing plugins.
  1. install a plugin: `wpm install <plug-in name>`
  2. remove the plug-in: `wpm uninstall <plug-in name>`
  3. the installed plugins: `wpm list`

* Download Wox plugin packages, installing manually.  

  If for some reason, user cannot use the `WPM` to install plugins.
  Users may  download the plugin package to a local (ending with wox), and then drag the plugin package to Wox search box.
